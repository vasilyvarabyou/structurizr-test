=== Journey-2: move calls to adaptors from service layer to processors

==== Context

Just for demo purpose I need to make a change to the architecture for review. I want to assess how it looks like and to understand is it comfortable enough to use in real life projects.

==== Decision

That's why we remove calls from *A-Service* to *The Adaptor* and *3rd Adaptor* and make it from *A Processor*. Also I have eventually decided that I want to have a look how call chain will look like. That's why I have decided to introduce *2nd Processor*

Also I've decided to update documentation structure to introduce ADRs.

==== Consequences

I expect to get a sample pull request and updated diagrams.
